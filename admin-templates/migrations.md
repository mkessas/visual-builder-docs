{% tabs %}
{% tab title="React" %}
As this is major change it breaks some components in the app.  
Take a look into:

* **config-overrides.js**: Added `.eslintrc.js` loader;
* **kit-base**: All Sellpixels templates will now work on a universal architecture using KIT as a base. The components of the template have been moved to a separate folder. This will prevent problems with widgets and applications update in future releases;
* **antd**: Old loader removed from `config-overrides.js`, now theme variables applies direct in less files with `apply()` function, check `kit/vendors/antd/themes/dark.less`. Antd styles now imported in `src/index.js`
* **themes:** Default and dark theme styles applied by ****`data-kit-theme=""` attribute on html tag
* **mixins.scss**: All components now import the shared `src/components/mixins.scss` file
* **deps**: Updated to latest versions
* **redesign**: Layout components was redesigned a little
